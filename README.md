This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>

# Install and run the application
To run the application you have to make sure the API server is running.
Go into the `api-server` folder and run the server after installing the dependencies. 
```
cd api-server
npm install
node server
```

Once the API server is up and running you can install the frontend dependencies and run the frontend part of the application 
by going to the `frontend` root folder and executing the following.
The browser will open the application automatically.
```
npm install
npm start
```
